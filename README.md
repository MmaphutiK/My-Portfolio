# My-Portfolio

My portfolio is more than just a collection of projects—it’s a reflection of my skills, growth, and passion for IT. Since I studied Information Technology in Business Systems, I focus on how technology can solve real-world business challenges rather than just building systems for the sake of it.

At the core of my portfolio is JoziRush, a tourism website I developed. This project showcases my ability to design and build functional web applications while keeping in mind user experience, business goals, and scalability. Through this, I was able to merge my interest in property, tourism, and technology, proving that I can create solutions that serve a purpose beyond just the technical side.

My portfolio also highlights my experience during my internship at Life Healthcare, where I gained hands-on exposure to how IT systems support business operations in a real-world corporate environment. This was a major learning curve for me, as it allowed me to apply problem-solving, data analysis, and business process optimization in a professional setting.

I also include smaller projects where I’ve worked with web development, data analytics, and IT system improvements. These demonstrate my ability to adapt and learn new technologies, as well as my drive to continuously improve my skills.

For me, my portfolio isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about proving that I can bridge the gap between technology and business needs. As I continue growing in my career, I’m actively working on expanding my expertise, refining my projects, and taking on more challenges that push me further
